It started as a collection of scripts and code I wrote / collected during my PhD and it evolves accordingly. As such, the framework is opinionated and it follows a convention over configuration approach. A heavy emphasis is put on: Enforcing best practices and reproducibility of experiments Making common things fast at the top-level and not having to go through extensive configuration options Remaining extendable. Extensions and modules for more use cases should be easy to add Out of the box extensive logging and experiment management Separating dirty / scratch code (at the script level) for quick changes and clean / polished code at the library level This is currently in alpha release under active development, so things may break and new features will be added. Dependencies We use Pytorch (1.7) and the following libraries Pytorch Lightning huggingface/transformers Wandb Python 3.8 Installation You can use slp as an external library by installing from PyPI with pip install slp Or you can clone it from github git clone git@github.com:georgepar/slp We use poetry for dependency management When you clone the repo run: pip install poetry poetry install and a clean environment with all the dependencies will be created. You can access it with poetry shell . Note : Wandb logging is enabled by default. You can either Create an account and run wandb login when you clone the repo in a new machine to store the results in the online managed environment Run wandb offline when you clone the repo to disable remote sync or use the --offline command line argument in your scripts Use one of their self-hosted solutions Create a new project based on slp You can use the template at https://github.com/georgepar/cookiecutter-pytorch-slp to create a new project based on slp pip install cookiecutter poetry cookiecutter gh:georgepar/cookiecutter-pytorch-slp # Follow the interactive configuration and a new folder with the project name you provided will appear cd $PROJECT_NAME poetry install # Installs slp and all other dependencies And you are good to go.

First we can see the model definition of a simple CNN classifier: class Net(nn.Module): def __init__(self, intermediate_hidden=50): super(Net, self).__init__() self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 10, kernel_size=5) self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(10, 20, kernel_size=5) self.conv2_drop = nn.Dropout2d() self.fc1 = nn.Linear(320, intermediate_hidden) self.fc2 = nn.Linear(intermediate_hidden, 10) def forward(self, x): x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv1(x), 2)) x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv2_drop(self.conv2(x)), 2)) x = x.view(-1, 320) x = F.relu(self.fc1(x)) x = F.dropout(x, training=self.training) x = self.fc2(x) return x The get_data function downloads MNIST and performs the preprocessing: def get_data(): data_transform = Compose([ToTensor(), Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))]) train = MNIST(download=True, root=\".\", transform=data_transform, train=True) val = MNIST(download=False, root=\".\", transform=data_transform, train=False) return train, val Finally the get_parser function creates a CLI parser for the model arguments. Note the destination variable model.intermediate_hidden (important for later): def get_parser(): parser = ArgumentParser(\"MNIST classification example\") parser.add_argument( \"--hidden\", dest=\"model.intermediate_hidden\", type=int, default=12, help=\"Intermediate hidden layers for linear module\", ) return parser Setup You would create these functions whether you use slp or not. The interesting part is in the main function. Here we first need to perform some setup for logging, configuration parsing and seeding. Let's go through this step-by-step: First we create the CLI args parser. make_cli_parser takes the parser we defined in get_parser() and extends it with generic arguments for the data, optimizers, learning rate scheduling, training and experiment tracking. Run python mnist.py --help for a full list of arguments, or go down in the Appendix. The arguments have a detailed description and most of them default to None so they will not be used. parser = get_parser() parser = make_cli_parser(parser, PLDataModuleFromDatasets) Next we parse the configuration. Here we need to provide the parser and (optionally) a YAML configuration file python mnist.py --config my-config.yaml . The configuration file should have the following format: model: intermediate_hidden: 100 optimizer: Adam optim: lr: 1e-3 lr_scheduler: true # ReduceLROnPlateau lr_schedule: factor: 2 data: batch_size: 128 batch_size_eval: 256 Note that this format, closely follows the dest values we configure in the command line args (e.g. OPTIM.LR , LR_SCHEDULE.FACTOR ), namely the dots. form a hierarchy. This way we can use parse_config to merge the values in the configuration file and the CLI args. The precedence is as follows: default CLI args < config file values < user provided CLI args So if we call the script with --lr 1e-4 this value will overwrite the value in the configuration file. If a value is not specified in the configuration file, the default value we specified in argparse will be set. If a value is not specified in any of these places, sane defaults will be used. config = parse_config(parser, parser.parse_args().config) if config.trainer.experiment_name == \"experiment\": config.trainer.experiment_name = \"mnist-classification\" Next, we configure logging. This call configures loguru to intercept all logs and print the both to stdout and a log file. The log file name will depend on the experiment name we provided and datetime.now() , to avoid overwriting previous runs (e.g. mnist-classification.20210302-134714.log ). configure_logging(f\"logs/{config.trainer.experiment_name}\") Finally, we make the run deterministic ( --seed ) if config.seed is not None: logger.info(\"Seeding everything with seed={seed}\") pl.utilities.seed.seed_everything(seed=config.seed) Data Module Here we download the train and test datasets and define the LightningDataModule that will be used in this experiment. The LightningDataModule is the preferred way to consume datasets in pytorch lightning, and PLDataModuleFromDatasets abstracts the boilerplate of constructing and configuring the DataLoaders , splitting data etc. Note : PLDataModuleFromDatasets expects three torch.utils.data.Datasets as input, train, val and test. Val and test are optional. If any of the validation or tests sets are not provided, PLDataModuleFromDatasets will create a split using 20% of the train set by default (see --val-percent , --test-percent ). train, test = get_data() ldm = PLDataModuleFromDatasets(train, test=test, seed=config.seed, **config.data) # Note we pass **config.data, because config is in a hierarchy. Defining the model Next we define the model, optimizer, criterion and learning rate scheduler (pretty standard). model = Net(**config.model) optimizer = getattr(optim, config.optimizer)(model.parameters(), **config.optim) criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() lr_scheduler = None if config.lr_scheduler: lr_scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau( optimizer, **config.lr_schedule ) And the LightningModule that will be used for training. This module takes care of defining the train and validation steps, computing and logging metrics etc. Note that pytorch lightning by default expects softmaxed outputs in the predefined metrics, so we wrap the metric with FromLogits to use crossentropy loss. lm = PLModule( model, optimizer, criterion, lr_scheduler=lr_scheduler, metrics={\"acc\": FromLogits(pl.metrics.classification.Accuracy())}, hparams=config, # We pass this so that configuration will be logged in wandb ) Training and Debugging Finally, we have the option to run a full training and testing phase of the model, or run a quick debug execution. If we need to debug, we can pass --debug flag, and the trainer will run a full training, validation run on 5 batches. It will also try to overfit the model on 5 batches to verify that gradients flow. # Run debugging session or fit & test the model ############ if config.debug: logger.info(\"Running in debug mode: Fast run on 5 batches\") trainer = make_trainer(fast_dev_run=5) trainer.fit(lm, datamodule=ldm) logger.info(\"Running in debug mode: Overfitting 5 batches\") trainer = make_trainer(overfit_batches=5) trainer.fit(lm, datamodule=ldm) If we run in normal mode, we fit on train / val sets and evaluate the best model on the test set. The best model is selected as the model with the smallest validation loss. Training will run with early stopping, the best 3 checkpoints will be saved, all the jazz. Note watch_model tells wandb to track weight norms and gradients for further inspection. else: trainer = make_trainer(**config.trainer) watch_model(trainer, model) trainer.fit(lm, datamodule=ldm) trainer.test(ckpt_path=\"best\", test_dataloaders=ldm.test_dataloader()) logger.info(\"Run finished. Uploading files to wandb...\") Sure, most of this goodness comes from the awesome team in pytorch lightning. But what we do here is we abstract the boilerplate and the large learning curve, without making sacrifices in the features. For example, you can play spot the differences between examples/mnist.py , which performs digit classification and examples/smt_bert.py which finetunes BERT for sentiment classification on SST-2. The classes we use change, but the way they are called, the structure and features remains the same. # smt_bert.py ... if __name__ == \"__main__\": parser = get_parser() parser = make_cli_parser(parser, PLDataModuleFromCorpus) args = parser.parse_args() config_file = args.config config = parse_config(parser, config_file) # Set these by default. config.hugging_face_model = config.data.tokenizer config.data.add_special_tokens = True config.data.lower = \"uncased\" in config.hugging_face_model if config.trainer.experiment_name == \"experiment\": config.trainer.experiment_name = \"finetune-bert-smt\" configure_logging(f\"logs/{config.trainer.experiment_name}\") if config.seed is not None: logger.info(\"Seeding everything with seed={seed}\") pl.utilities.seed.seed_everything(seed=config.seed) ( raw_train, labels_train, raw_dev, labels_dev, raw_test, labels_test, num_labels, ) = get_data(config) ldm = PLDataModuleFromCorpus( raw_train, labels_train, val=raw_dev, val_labels=labels_dev, test=raw_test, test_labels=labels_test, collate_fn=collate_fn, **config.data, ) model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained( config.hugging_face_model, num_labels=num_labels ) logger.info(model) # Leave this hardcoded for now. optimizer = AdamW([p for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad], lr=1e-5) criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() lm = BertPLModule( model, optimizer, criterion, metrics={\"acc\": FromLogits(pl.metrics.classification.Accuracy())}, ) trainer = make_trainer(**config.trainer) watch_model(trainer, model) trainer.fit(lm, datamodule=ldm) trainer.test(ckpt_path=\"best\", test_dataloaders=ldm.test_dataloader()) Appendix.

Note, this is not in line with the pytorch-lightning mantra where everything about an experiment should be contained in a single module. I agree this can help reproducibility, but I find it tedious to always copy and paste or even worse rewrite boilerplate code for metric calculation and implementing hooks. With the extensive logging and sane configuration management in slp, reproducibility while developing new models is less of an issue.

Let's walk through the examples/mnist_tune.py script for a concrete example. This script has been modified from examples/mnist.py that was presented in Getting started , to perform a distributed hyperparameter parameter tuning run using Ray Tune and the SLP utilities. First we refactor the model creation and training into a function, so that each worker is able to instantiate and train a model. from slp.plbind.trainer import make_trainer_for_ray_tune ... def train_mnist(config, train=None, val=None): # Convert dictionary to omegaconf dictconfig object config = OmegaConf.create(config) # Create data module ldm = PLDataModuleFromDatasets( train, val=val, seed=config.seed, no_test_set=True, **config.data ) # Create model, optimizer, criterion, scheduler model = Net(**config.model) optimizer = getattr(optim, config.optimizer)(model.parameters(), **config.optim) criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() lr_scheduler = None if config.lr_scheduler: lr_scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau( optimizer, **config.lr_schedule ) # Wrap in PLModule, & configure metrics lm = PLModule( model, optimizer, criterion, lr_scheduler=lr_scheduler, metrics={ \"acc\": FromLogits(pl.metrics.classification.Accuracy()) }, # Will log train_acc and val_acc hparams=config, ) # Map Lightning metrics to ray tune metris. metrics_map = {\"accuracy\": \"val_acc\", \"validation_loss\": \"val_loss\"} assert ( config[\"tune\"][\"metric\"] in metrics_map.keys() ), \"Metrics mapping should contain the metric you are trying to optimize\" # Train model trainer = make_trainer_for_ray_tune(metrics_map=metrics_map, **config.trainer) trainer.fit(lm, datamodule=ldm) This function is pretty similar to the examples/mnist.py code, but there are some important notes to keep in mind here. The function accepts a config dictionary as a positional argument and the train and validation datasets as keyword arguments. This is important, because run_tuning expects the input training function to have this stub. We convert the input dict to an omegaconf.DictConfig object for convenience. Unfortunately ray tune is not able to pass around OmegaConf configuration objects so we need to convert back and forth. Take note of the metrics_map . This mapping renames the metrics aggregated by our pytorch lightning module so that they are logged for ray tune. One of the keys of this dict is going to be chosen as the metric to optimize We use the make_trainer_for_ray_tune To create a trainer that is configured specifically for a tuning run Next we define the configure_search_space function, that overrides entries in the configuration file with ranges, from which ray tune will sample values for the hyperparameters. def configure_search_space(config): config[\"model\"] = { \"intermediate_hidden\": tune.choice([16, 32, 64, 100, 128, 256, 300, 512]) } config[\"optimizer\"] = tune.choice([\"SGD\", \"Adam\", \"AdamW\"]) config[\"optim\"][\"lr\"] = tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1) config[\"optim\"][\"weight_decay\"] = tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1) config[\"data\"][\"batch_size\"] = tune.choice([16, 32, 64, 128]) return config As you can see, we are going to tune the learning rate, weight decay, optimizer, batch size and the hidden size of our model. Note : I considered abstracting this into a configuration file, but I don't have any use case for this kind of abstraction and the simplicity and flexibility we get from keeping this in code is more important. Finally we parse the config file and the CLI arguments and spawn the hyperparameter tuning in the main function: from slp.util.tuning import run_tuning ... if __name__ == \"__main__\": config = ... train, val, _ = get_data() best_config = run_tuning( config, \"configs/best.mnist.tune.yml\", train_mnist, configure_search_space, train, val, ) The run_tuning function accepts * The parsed configuration as an omegaconf.DictConfig object * A path to save the best trial configuration as a yaml file * The train_mnist function * The configure_search_space function * The train dataset * The validation dataset Note that we create the train and validation splits by hand, so that each trial runs on the same validation set. The script can be called with the following arguments: python examples/minst_tune.py --num-trials 1000 --cpus_per_trial 1 --gpus_per_trial 0.12 --tune-metric accuracy --tune-mode max --epochs 20 This will spawn 1000 trials over as many gpus as we have available (in our server or in our cluster). The --gpus_per_trial argument can be a floating point number. In this case we pack 7-8 experiments per GPU (RTX 2080Ti). Note the --tune-metric argument corresponds to one of the keys in the metrics_map dictionary. Here we run the tuning to optimize for validation accuracy. After the run finishes we can use the configs/best.mnist.tune.yml configuration file to train and evaluate the best model on the test set python examples/mnist.py --config configs/best.mnist.tune.yml Note : mnist_tune.py can accept any configuration file and command line argument that mnist.py can accept.

Let's walk through the examples/mnist_tune.py script for a concrete example. This script has been modified from examples/mnist.py that was presented in Getting started , to perform a distributed hyperparameter parameter tuning run using Ray Tune and the SLP utilities. First we refactor the model creation and training into a function, so that each worker is able to instantiate and train a model. from slp.plbind.trainer import make_trainer_for_ray_tune ... def train_mnist(config, train=None, val=None): # Convert dictionary to omegaconf dictconfig object config = OmegaConf.create(config) # Create data module ldm = PLDataModuleFromDatasets( train, val=val, seed=config.seed, no_test_set=True, **config.data ) # Create model, optimizer, criterion, scheduler model = Net(**config.model) optimizer = getattr(optim, config.optimizer)(model.parameters(), **config.optim) criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() lr_scheduler = None if config.lr_scheduler: lr_scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau( optimizer, **config.lr_schedule ) # Wrap in PLModule, & configure metrics lm = PLModule( model, optimizer, criterion, lr_scheduler=lr_scheduler, metrics={ \"acc\": FromLogits(pl.metrics.classification.Accuracy()) }, # Will log train_acc and val_acc hparams=config, ) # Map Lightning metrics to ray tune metris. metrics_map = {\"accuracy\": \"val_acc\", \"validation_loss\": \"val_loss\"} assert ( config[\"tune\"][\"metric\"] in metrics_map.keys() ), \"Metrics mapping should contain the metric you are trying to optimize\" # Train model trainer = make_trainer_for_ray_tune(metrics_map=metrics_map, **config.trainer) trainer.fit(lm, datamodule=ldm) This function is pretty similar to the examples/mnist.py code, but there are some important notes to keep in mind here. The function accepts a config dictionary as a positional argument and the train and validation datasets as keyword arguments. This is important, because run_tuning expects the input training function to have this stub. We convert the input dict to an omegaconf.DictConfig object for convenience. Unfortunately ray tune is not able to pass around OmegaConf configuration objects so we need to convert back and forth. Take note of the metrics_map . This mapping renames the metrics aggregated by our pytorch lightning module so that they are logged for ray tune. One of the keys of this dict is going to be chosen as the metric to optimize We use the make_trainer_for_ray_tune To create a trainer that is configured specifically for a tuning run Next we define the configure_search_space function, that overrides entries in the configuration file with ranges, from which ray tune will sample values for the hyperparameters. def configure_search_space(config): config[\"model\"] = { \"intermediate_hidden\": tune.choice([16, 32, 64, 100, 128, 256, 300, 512]) } config[\"optimizer\"] = tune.choice([\"SGD\", \"Adam\", \"AdamW\"]) config[\"optim\"][\"lr\"] = tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1) config[\"optim\"][\"weight_decay\"] = tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1) config[\"data\"][\"batch_size\"] = tune.choice([16, 32, 64, 128]) return config As you can see, we are going to tune the learning rate, weight decay, optimizer, batch size and the hidden size of our model. Note : I considered abstracting this into a configuration file, but I don't have any use case for this kind of abstraction and the simplicity and flexibility we get from keeping this in code is more important. Finally we parse the config file and the CLI arguments and spawn the hyperparameter tuning in the main function: from slp.util.tuning import run_tuning ... if __name__ == \"__main__\": config = ... train, val, _ = get_data() best_config = run_tuning( config, \"configs/best.mnist.tune.yml\", train_mnist, configure_search_space, train, val, ) The run_tuning function accepts * The parsed configuration as an omegaconf.DictConfig object * A path to save the best trial configuration as a yaml file * The train_mnist function * The configure_search_space function * The train dataset * The validation dataset Note that we create the train and validation splits by hand, so that each trial runs on the same validation set. The script can be called with the following arguments: python examples/minst_tune.py --num-trials 1000 --cpus_per_trial 1 --gpus_per_trial 0.12 --tune-metric accuracy --tune-mode max --epochs 20 This will spawn 1000 trials over as many gpus as we have available (in our server or in our cluster). The --gpus_per_trial argument can be a floating point number. In this case we pack 7-8 experiments per GPU (RTX 2080Ti). Note the --tune-metric argument corresponds to one of the keys in the metrics_map dictionary. Here we run the tuning to optimize for validation accuracy. After the run finishes we can use the configs/best.mnist.tune.yml configuration file to train and evaluate the best model on the test set python examples/mnist.py --config configs/best.mnist.tune.yml Note : mnist_tune.py can accept any configuration file and command line argument that mnist.py can accept.
